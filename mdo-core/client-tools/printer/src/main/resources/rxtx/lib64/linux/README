These native libraries come from librxtx-java_2.2pre2-3_amd64.deb. The later file comes from the cache of command "apt-get librxtx-java".

This version of RXTX native libraries is 2.2pre1 for AMD 64 bits.

The files librxtxParallel.so and librxtxSerial.so are the same as librxtxParallel-2.2pre1.so and librxtxSerial-2.2pre1.so: We just rename them.
